# NBA-player-position-predicting
A Data Science Project in Python that predict the Position of the player base on their data and statistic
In basketball, there are a lot of reasons that the coach should consider before deciding which positon he want his players to play at. For example: his percentage of 3 Point shoot, 2 Point shoot, his height, weight,...
In this project, I use the algorithm Multinomial Logistic Regression, to predict a player position based on his statistic in match and his physicals
This is my very first project in Data Science that I came up with the idea and implemented myself, and the accuracy of the model is not really good.
However, hope you can see my project as for begginer and give me star if you like my idea. Thank you
